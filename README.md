# Key Tube
Key Tube is a learning case attempt at implementing a YouTube-like system using AWS technology

This is not a customer case. It is a learning case. Thus, this system is not complete,
and probably never will be. The purpose is to learn how to use various AWS technologies
together - not necessarily to create a fully functional YouTube-like system.

The goal of creating a YouTube-like system is just a guide to pull me (or other learners) 
through an easy-to-understand use case and set of requirements, which span a good
portion of central and peripheric AWS services.

The system uses the following AWS services:

 - S3
   - Storage of static website (HTML, images, scripts etc.)
   - Storage of media files (Video etc.)
 - DynamoDB
   - Storage of user account information, such as media files uploaded etc.
 - Cognito (??) - for user authentication (??)
 - AWS Media services (??)
 - Other AWS services - depending on how far this project gets.
